          The <strong>Sand Cat</strong> <em><abbr title="Felis margarita">(F. margarita)</abbr></em
          >, also known as <strong>sand dune cat</strong> is a small wild cat that inhabits
          exclusively in desert habitat in Asia and Africa. They have very well adapted to life in
          the desert that they are able to live without water.

        <p>
          Sand cats are one of the smallest living animals in the desert. The body length of a sand
          cat is between 40 ~ 52cm. Albeit it has a petite body, the sand cat has a relatively long
          tail of 20 ~ 30cm. Sand cats weigh only 1.5 ~ 3.5kg, whereas a regular adult domestic cat
          weighs around 5kg and sometimes more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their fur is in a sandy yellow so that they can blend into the desert environment better.
          Brown streaks also run across their cheeks and the feet, tail area. Their bodies only have
          faint stripes and around the belly area the fur is whiter. Since they are nocturnal
          animals, they have large eyes and furry ears that set low on their face to help them to
          hunt at night, and the fur in the ears act as a sort of protection against occasional
          sandstorms.

        <p>
          Since sand cats live in the desert, the temperature varied dramatically between day and
          night, sand cats dig a lot to create burrows to not only keep themselves from the heat in
          the daytime to prevent water loss as there are very limited water resources in the desert.
          Due to frequent digging, unlike the regular cats we know, sand cats' claws cannot be fully
          retracted and are not very sharp.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sand cats are solitary species, they do not usually gather together unless it is for
          mating. If kep in captive, they can live up to 17 years with a litter size of average 3
          cubs. And to one's surprise, sand cats are not good climbers nor jumpers, they are more of
          a "down to earth" type of cats. With their exceptional hearing sense, they are able to
          detect prey, usually rodents, underneath the sand and dig them out. Sand cats also hunt
          birds, spiders, insects, and reptiles. Sand cats are able to sustain their moisture needs
          from the prey, which is one of the reasons why they can adapt to desert so well.

        <p>
          Sand cats prefer dry, arid habitats with little vegetation mixed with sandy and rocky
          areas and avoid bare and shifting sand dunes because of minimal prey supplies. They can be
          found mainly in Africa's Sahara desert, parts of central Asia and Arabian peninsula.

        <h2 id="Main-threats">Main Threats</h2>
        <p>
          Although under <abbr title=" International Union for Conservation of Nature">IUCN</abbr>,
          sand cats are under least concern categories. Due to their low population, they are not
          easy to be sighted. In Abu Dhabi's Al Gharbia area, the sand cats were not sighted from
          2003 till 2015, marking an absence of sightings for over 10 years!
        </p>
        <p>
          The major threat to the sand cat is habitat loss and degradation. Because of human
          settlements and activities, the arid ecosystems disappear quickly and thus threaten our
          lovely cute sand cats here. Such as in the Arabian Peninsula, where the sand dune habitat
          is declining because of political conflicts. Habitat loss can also cause the decline of
          sand cats' prey, which then indirectly affect the region's livability for sand cats.
          Additional threats are the introduction to domestic pets, such as dogs and cats, this
          creates direct competition for prey, predation and disease transmission. The threat from
          domestic pets is most prominent in Iran, sand cats are often killed by shepherd dogs, or
          fell for traps meant for other animals. <br />

            desert can be above 50 degree Celsius in the day time and drop to 0 degree Celsius at
            night! Furthermore, the pads provide traction so that they can move swiftly across
            shifting sands and barely leave any trace behind.

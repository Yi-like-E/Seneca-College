    <h1>RE: An HTML Letter</h1>
    <p>Dear WEB222 Student:</p>
    <p>
      The <strong>first</strong> paragraph of a <em>typical</em> business letter
      is used to state the main point of the letter. Begin with a friendly
      opening, then quickly transition into the purpose of your letter. Use a
      couple of sentences to explain the purpose, but do not go into detail
      until the next paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beginning with the second paragraph, state the supporting details to
      justify your purpose. These may take various forms, including:
      <ul>
        <li>background information</li>
        <li>statistics</li>
        <li>first-hand accounts</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      A few short paragraphs within the body of the letter should be enough to support your reasoning. For example, you could include a quote like the following:
      <blockquote><q>I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.</q> Douglas Adams</blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>It's obviously a good idea to include hyperlinks like <a href="https://www.senecacollege.ca/home.html">this one to Seneca's home page</a>.</p>
    <p>
      Also, if you want to showcase some of your source code, do that with an appropriate element to make it look correct, for example 
      <code>&ltimg src=https://live.staticflickr.com/155/354864230_a8fe1fe864_z.jpg alt="cat"&gt</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, in the closing paragraph, briefly restate your purpose and why it is important. If the purpose of your letter is employment related, consider 
      ending your letter with your contact information./however, if the purpose is informational, think about closing with gratitude for the reader's time. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
